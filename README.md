# OrganizeMe - React Task Management App

OrganizeMe is a simple task management application built using React. This app allows you to organize your tasks into columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." You can drag and drop tasks between columns and easily add new tasks. IThe app has minimalistic yet stylish design without any unnecessary functions, so one can focus on their to-do's. It even has it's own cute favicon :)

## Features

- Create and manage tasks in three different columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- Drag and drop tasks between columns for easy task management.
- Add new tasks by entering a task description and clicking the "Add" button or pressing Enter.
- Delete tasks by clicking on a task, which reveals a "Delete" button.

## Usage

- To add a new task, enter a task description in the input field under a column and click the "Add" button or press Enter.
- To move a task to a different column, drag and drop the task card to the desired column.
- To delete a task, click on the task card, and a "Delete" button will appear. Click the "Delete" button to remove the task.
